        <p>
            My name is Nicholas Moss and I was born in and currently living in Tucson Arizona. I have most of my background in hospitality and customer service
            where I worked with all different situations the service industry has to offer. I recently just made the leap to become a Full-Stack Web Developer
            by enrolling into the University of Arizona's Full Stack Bootcamp and am excited to get started learning and getting into the real world of Web
            Development.
            I have become enthralled with the challenges that development has to offer, making my main goal to create a career using the skills I have learned in
            my classes including HTML, CSS and Javascript so far with more to come.
